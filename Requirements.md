# Q. Implementing the basic functionality of linux command which is GREP.

# What is grep?
```
Grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular
expression or simply a string. E.g.

## Task A
```
You shall utilize the knowledge obtained from the string matching algorithms taught in
class and come up with a solution that achieves the following: (where n = pattern length
or string to be searched, m = length of text)

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)
- Pre-processing time complexity: O(m)
```

## Task B
```
Your grep results should be well formatted and the matching strings should appear as:
Example Output:
> grep 'said' *.txt
Output:
String: said
File # 1:
appeared at index 41 line 8
File # 2:
appeared at index 20 line 16
appeared at index 3 line 19
And so on...
- You must perform search for following text and show output:
“said”
```
